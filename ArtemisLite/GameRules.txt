Game Rules: 

Game Objective:
The game is won when all elements on the board have been fully developed and the Artemis mission is ready to launch.
When a player runs out of resources they are declared bankrupt, the game will end and the scores will be calculated to find the most successful player.
Can your team acquire and fully develop all of the systems needed for a successful Lift-off? or will you just be in it for personal gain?

Components:
A board that contains 4 systems, 1 resource square and 1 blank square.
Each system consists of 2 or 3 elements, each of which can have 3 minor developments and 1 major development.
The game contains 2 of 6-sided dice.

Setup:
1. Between 2 and 4 players (companies) can be added to the game and can decide their own names. 
2. Players can select either a Long or Short game. In a short game, players will accrue more staff-hours (currency) per turn. 
3. Each player rolls the dice, highest roll goes first. 

Game Play:
1. The dice are thrown and the player moves by the number of elements indicated.
2. If the player lands on an unowned element, they will be given the option to take ownership by investing staff-hours. If they have insufficient staff-hours or do not want to invest in the element then it will be offered to all other players at the original cost.
3. If the player lands on an owned element, they may be required to forfeit some staff-hours to the elements owner.
4. The player will then be presented with other possible options for their turn such as viewing free elements or increasing development level of their elements.

Recruitment Agency:
Any player that lands on or passes the Recruitment Agency will receive 20,000 or 100 staff-hours for short or long games respectively.

Public Holiday:
This element may not be owned, and will not require the player to forfeit any staff-hours.

Bankrupt:
A player is declared bankrupt if their number of staff-hours falls or would fall below 0. Players may not borrow or lend money, however they can choose to not poach staff-hours from another player that lands on their element.
